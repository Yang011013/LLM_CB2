Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

        ### Instruction:
        
You would be provided with a instrction and an structured string to describe your first-view map.
Your task is to break down the original instruction into two categories based on the map:
1. Immediate Tasks: Tasks that are achievable within your current perspective and can be completed promptly. Type 1: Change Direction (e.g., "Turn left/right/Around") Type 2: Move to a specific location in the first-view map(e.g., "Next Location: Tile at heading <angle> and distance <distance>: <GROUND_TILE_TYPE>"). Type 3: Interact with a Card at a Specific Location within the visible area of the map.
2. Deferred Tasks: Tasks that necessitate a change in perspective or additional insights to be accomplished. If there are no deferred tasks, record the output as "NULL".

Provide your answer in JSON format with the following keys:Immediate Task, Deferred Task. Other formats are not accepted.
Expected Output Format:
{"Immediate Task": Either a direction change (e.g., "Turn left/right/Around") or a specific location (e.g., "Next Location: Tile at heading <angle> and distance <distance>: <GROUND_TILE_TYPE>","Card Interaction:   <interaction>  at Tile at heading <angle> and distance <distance>: <GROUND_TILE_TYPE>"),
"Deferred Task": "NULL" or a consice description of the remaining instructions in no more then 20 words.}
