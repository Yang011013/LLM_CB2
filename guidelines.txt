Some guidelines for development to keep things nice:

- Focus on readability. Before pushing commits, take a good look at your code
  and ask yourself if it's something someone else could reasonably understand
without too much of a headache. If not, consider adding comments in the code or
re-organizing to simplify things.

- Try to follow a coding style consistent with the rest of the code base. This
  reduces overhead when reading unfamiliar code. Give this a read:

- Local consistency is preferable to global consistency. Notice a deviation
  from the style guide that's made everywhere in the rest of the file? Either
conform to the deviation or fix it everywhere.

- Don't be pedantic in code reviews. Style guide fixes are really only useful
  if it's egregious. Prioritize finding bugs in the code or missed
  opportunities to optimize an algorithm (or improving the readability/places
  where a comment could be useful)

- Rebase + FF, don't Merge. I know git takes a while to get used to but please
  spend the time to make sure you're preserving a linear edit history. Rebase
  and merge don't play well together, so it's worth sticking to only one:

And if we're only going to use one, I prefer rebase because it means simpler
edit histories.

Here's some resources:

- Please don't git force push unless you're confident in your understanding of why
  it's required and what is going to happen.

- This isn't a guideline, but I've decided to make sure of the fill/drain
terminology for function calls that handle network messages. Let's say you have
a message providing function:

    def fill_messages(out_messages: List[Any]) -> bool:
        ...

Then fill_messages() will fill out_messages (a list) with messages to process and
return True if any messages were added (False if none available).

Similarly, let's say you have a message consuming function:

    def drain_messages(messages: List[Any]) -> None:
        ...

drain_messages() consumes the messages in parameter `messages`.
