First you must type in your thoughts. You can do this by starting a line with 'THOUGHTS:' and then typing your thoughts on the same line (important!). Then type in your intended action. You can do this by starting a line with 'ACTIONS:' and then typing a comma-separate list of actions, ending with newline.E.G. a List of: 'R', 'L', 'F', 'B', or 'D' (Right, Left, Forward, Back, Done). Actions MUST be one of these single-letters. Use 'D' to mark the instruction as completed. You cannot see things behind you or to the sides. You also can't see things that are too far away. Turn around or move to explore. After a few observations, if you're lost, use a 'D'one action to get a new instruction. Headings are described in degrees, with positive meaning to the right and negative meaning to the left. You are on a discrete hex grid, each turn is 60 degrees. You get a new observation each time you move. Do not hit 'done' until you have completed the instruction. The leader can see things you can't, so trust instructions. After each ACTION line, you will get a new observation, so you can explore a bit. There are no traps, so explore freely.

{'role': 'user', 'parts': "GAME EXPLANATION: \nYou are playing a text-based videogame. In this game, you are the FOLLOWER. Your role is to follow the ACTIVE instruction. First you must type in your thoughts. You can do this by starting a line with 'THOUGHTS:' and then typing your thoughts on the same line (important!). Then type in your intended action. You can do this by starting a line with 'ACTIONS:' and then typing a comma-separate list of actions, ending with newline.E.G. a List of: 'R', 'L', 'F', 'B', or 'D' (Right, Left, Forward, Back, Done). Actions MUST be one of these single-letters. Use 'D' to mark the instruction as completed. You cannot see things behind you or to the sides. You also can't see things that are too far away. Turn around or move to explore. After a few observations, if you're lost, use a 'D'one action to get a new instruction. Headings are described in degrees, with positive meaning to the right and negative meaning to the left. You are on a discrete hex grid, each turn is 60 degrees. You get a new observation each time you move. Do not hit 'done' until you have completed the instruction. The leader can see things you can't, so trust instructions. After each ACTION line, you will get a new observation, so you can explore a bit. There are no traps, so explore freely. Outposts, and cities are just waypoints, and have no clues."}{'role': 'model', 'parts': 'Okay, I already know the rules.'}{'role': 'user', 'parts': "MAP DIMENSIONS:\n\t25x25 hexagon map with 0 props. \nINSTRUCTIONS\n\tStatus: ACTIVE, Instruction: turn back and go staright to get the card among the houses\n\nPROP DESCRIPTIONS\n\t\nTURN_STATE\n\tMoves remaining: 10.\n\tWho's turn it is: Role.FOLLOWER.\n\tTurns left before end of game: 6.\n\tCurrent Score: 0.\n\tGame Over:False\n\nMAP DESCRIPTION\n\tCity of size 2 at Path to reach: left, forward, right, forward, left, forward.\n\tOutpost at Path not in sight. distance: 6.1 units and heading: 34.7 degrees.\nNEARBY TILES\n\tLeft tile: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tRight tile: GROUND_TILE_TREE\n\tForward tile: GROUND_TILE_HOUSE_TRIPLE_BLUE\nFURTHER TILES\n\tTile at heading -60 and distance 0.0: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 30 and distance 1.7: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -0 and distance 3.0: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -19 and distance 2.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 19 and distance 2.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -41 and distance 2.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 41 and distance 2.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 30 and distance 3.5: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -46 and distance 3.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 46 and distance 3.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -37 and distance 4.4: GROUND_TILE_TREES\n\tTile at heading 37 and distance 4.4: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -9 and distance 5.6: GROUND_TILE_TREE\n\tTile at heading -19 and distance 5.3: GROUND_TILE_TREES_2\n\tTile at heading -35 and distance 6.1: GROUND_TILE_STONES_GREENBUSH\n\tTile at heading 35 and distance 6.1: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -44 and distance 6.2: GROUND_TILE_PATH"}{'role': 'model', 'parts': 'Okay, I already know the map information.'}{'role': 'user', 'parts': 'Now based on rules and information output:'}{'role': 'model', 'parts': "THOUGHTS: Ok, so I need to turn around and go straight to get the card among the houses.

{'role': 'user', 'parts': "GAME EXPLANATION: \nYou are playing a text-based videogame. In this game, you are the FOLLOWER. Your role is to follow the ACTIVE instruction. First you must type in your thoughts. You can do this by starting a line with 'THOUGHTS:' and then typing your thoughts on the same line (important!). Then type in your intended action. You can do this by starting a line with 'ACTIONS:' and then typing a comma-separate list of actions, ending with newline.E.G. a List of: 'R', 'L', 'F', 'B', or 'D' (Right, Left, Forward, Back, Done). Actions MUST be one of these single-letters. Use 'D' to mark the instruction as completed. You cannot see things behind you or to the sides. You also can't see things that are too far away. Turn around or move to explore. After a few observations, if you're lost, use a 'D'one action to get a new instruction. Headings are described in degrees, with positive meaning to the right and negative meaning to the left. You are on a discrete hex grid, each turn is 60 degrees. You get a new observation each time you move. Do not hit 'done' until you have completed the instruction. The leader can see things you can't, so trust instructions. After each ACTION line, you will get a new observation, so you can explore a bit. There are no traps, so explore freely.

{'role': 'user', 'parts': "GAME EXPLANATION: \nYou are playing a text-based videogame. In this game, you are the FOLLOWER. Your role is to follow the ACTIVE instruction. First you must type in your thoughts. You can do this by starting a line with 'THOUGHTS:' and then typing your thoughts on the same line (important!). Then type in your intended action. You can do this by starting a line with 'ACTIONS:' and then typing a comma-separate list of actions, ending with newline.E.G. a List of: 'R', 'L', 'F', 'B', or 'D' (Right, Left, Forward, Back, Done). Actions MUST be one of these single-letters. Use 'D' to mark the instruction as completed. You cannot see things behind you or to the sides. You also can't see things that are too far away. Turn around or move to explore. After a few observations, if you're lost, use a 'D'one action to get a new instruction. Headings are described in degrees, with positive meaning to the right and negative meaning to the left. You are on a discrete hex grid, each turn is 60 degrees.

{'role': 'user', 'parts': "GAME EXPLANATION: \nYou are playing a text-based videogame. In this game, you are the FOLLOWER. Your role is to follow the ACTIVE instruction. First you must type in your thoughts. You can do this by starting a line with 'THOUGHTS:' and then typing your thoughts on the same line (important!). Then type in your intended action. You can do this by starting a line with 'ACTIONS:' and then typing a comma-separate list of actions, ending with newline.E.G. a List of: 'R', 'L', 'F', 'B', or 'D' (Right, Left, Forward, Back, Done). Actions MUST be one of these single-letters. Use 'D' to mark the instruction as completed. You cannot see things behind you or to the sides. You also can't see things that are too far away. Turn around or move to explore. After a few observations, if you're lost, use a 'D'one action to get a new instruction. Headings are described in degrees, with positive meaning to the right and negative meaning to the left. You are on a discrete hex grid, each turn is 60 degrees. You get a new observation each time you move. Do not hit 'done' until you have completed the instruction. The leader can see things you can't, so trust instructions. After each ACTION line, you will get a new observation, so you can explore a bit. There are no traps, so explore freely. Outposts, and cities are just waypoints, and have no clues."}{'role': 'model', 'parts': 'Okay, I already know the rules.'}{'role': 'user', 'parts': "MAP DIMENSIONS:\n\t25x25 hexagon map with 0 props. \nINSTRUCTIONS\n\tStatus: ACTIVE, Instruction: turn back and go staright to get the card among the houses\n\nPROP DESCRIPTIONS\n\t\nTURN_STATE\n\tMoves remaining: 10.\n\tWho's turn it is: Role.FOLLOWER.\n\tTurns left before end of game: 6.\n\tCurrent Score: 0.\n\tGame Over:False\n\nMAP DESCRIPTION\n\tCity of size 2 at Path to reach: left, forward, right, forward, left, forward.\n\tOutpost at Path not in sight. distance: 6.1 units and heading: 34.7 degrees.\nNEARBY TILES\n\tLeft tile: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tRight tile: GROUND_TILE_TREE\n\tForward tile: GROUND_TILE_HOUSE_TRIPLE_BLUE\nFURTHER TILES\n\tTile at heading -60 and distance 0.0: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 30 and distance 1.7: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -0 and distance 3.0: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -19 and distance 2.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 19 and distance 2.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -41 and distance 2.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 41 and distance 2.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 30 and distance 3.5: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -46 and distance 3.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 46 and distance 3.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -37 and distance 4.4: GROUND_TILE_TREES\n\tTile at heading 37 and distance 4.4: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -9 and distance 5.6: GROUND_TILE_TREE\n\tTile at heading -19 and distance 5.3: GROUND_TILE_TREES_2\n\tTile at heading -35 and distance 6.1: GROUND_TILE_STONES_GREENBUSH\n\tTile at heading 35 and distance 6.1: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -44 and distance 6.2: GROUND_TILE_PATH"}{'role': 'model', 'parts': 'Okay, I already know the map information.'}{'role': 'user', 'parts': 'Now based on rules and information output:'}{'role': 'model', 'parts': "THOUGHTS: Ok, so I need to turn around and go straight to get the card among the houses.

{'role': 'user', 'parts': "GAME EXPLANATION: \nYou are playing a text-based videogame. In this game, you are the FOLLOWER. Your role is to follow the ACTIVE instruction. First you must type in your thoughts. You can do this by starting a line with 'THOUGHTS:' and then typing your thoughts on the same line (important!). Then type in your intended action. You can do this by starting a line with 'ACTIONS:' and then typing a comma-separate list of actions, ending with newline.E.G. a List of: 'R', 'L', 'F', 'B', or 'D' (Right, Left, Forward, Back, Done). Actions MUST be one of these single-letters. Use 'D' to mark the instruction as completed. You cannot see things behind you or to the sides. You also can't see things that are too far away. Turn around or move to explore. After a few observations, if you're lost, use a 'D'one action to get a new instruction. Headings are described in degrees, with positive meaning to the right and negative meaning to the left. You are on a discrete hex grid, each turn is 60 degrees. You get a new observation each time you move. Do not hit 'done' until you have completed the instruction. The leader can see things you can't, so trust instructions. After each ACTION line, you will get a new observation, so you can explore a bit. There are no traps, so explore freely.

{'role': 'user', 'parts': "GAME EXPLANATION: \nYou are playing a text-based videogame. In this game, you are the FOLLOWER. Your role is to follow the ACTIVE instruction. First you must type in your thoughts. You can do this by starting a line with 'THOUGHTS:' and then typing your thoughts on the same line (important!). Then type in your intended action. You can do this by starting a line with 'ACTIONS:' and then typing a comma-separate list of actions, ending with newline.E.G. a List of: 'R', 'L', 'F', 'B', or 'D' (Right, Left, Forward, Back, Done). Actions MUST be one of these single-letters. Use 'D' to mark the instruction as completed. You cannot see things behind you or to the sides. You also can't see things that are too far away. Turn around or move to explore. After a few observations, if you're lost, use a 'D'one action to get a new instruction. Headings are described in degrees, with positive meaning to the right and negative meaning to the left. You are on a discrete hex grid, each turn is 60 degrees. You get a new observation each time you move. Do not hit 'done' until you have completed the instruction. The leader can see things you can't, so trust instructions. After each ACTION line, you will get a new observation, so you can explore a bit. There are no traps, so explore freely. Outposts, and cities are just waypoints, and have no clues."}{'role': 'model', 'parts': 'Okay, I already know the rules.'}{'role': 'user', 'parts': "MAP DIMENSIONS:\n\t25x25 hexagon map with 0 props. \nINSTRUCTIONS\n\tStatus: ACTIVE, Instruction: turn back and go staright to get the card among the houses\n\nPROP DESCRIPTIONS\n\t\nTURN_STATE\n\tMoves remaining: 10.\n\tWho's turn it is: Role.FOLLOWER.\n\tTurns left before end of game: 6.\n\tCurrent Score: 0.\n\tGame Over:False\n\nMAP DESCRIPTION\n\tCity of size 2 at Path to reach: left, forward, right, forward, left, forward.\n\tOutpost at Path not in sight. distance: 6.1 units and heading: 34.7 degrees.\nNEARBY TILES\n\tLeft tile: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tRight tile: GROUND_TILE_TREE\n\tForward tile: GROUND_TILE_HOUSE_TRIPLE_BLUE\nFURTHER TILES\n\tTile at heading -60 and distance 0.0: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 30 and distance 1.7: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -0 and distance 3.0: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -19 and distance 2.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 19 and distance 2.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -41 and distance 2.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 41 and distance 2.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 30 and distance 3.5: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -46 and distance 3.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading 46 and distance 3.6: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -37 and distance 4.4: GROUND_TILE_TREES\n\tTile at heading 37 and distance 4.4: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -9 and distance 5.6: GROUND_TILE_TREE\n\tTile at heading -19 and distance 5.3: GROUND_TILE_TREES_2\n\tTile at heading -35 and distance 6.1: GROUND_TILE_STONES_GREENBUSH\n\tTile at heading 35 and distance 6.1: GROUND_TILE_PATH\n\tTile at heading -44 and distance 6.2: GROUND_TILE_PATH"}{'role': 'model', 'parts': 'Okay, I already know the map information.'}{'role': 'user', 'parts': 'Now based on rules and information output:'}{'role': 'model', 'parts': "THOUGHTS: Ok, so I need to turn around and go straight to get the card among the houses.

{'role': 'user', 'parts': "GAME EXPLANATION: \nYou are playing a text-based videogame. In this game, you are the FOLLOWER. Your role is to follow the ACTIVE instruction. First you must type in your thoughts. You can do this by starting a line with 'THOUGHTS:' and then typing your thoughts on the same line (important!). Then type in your intended action. You can do this by starting a line with 'ACTIONS:' and then typing a comma-separate list of actions, ending with newline.E.G. a List of: 'R', 'L', 'F', 'B', or 'D' (Right, Left, Forward, Back, Done). Actions MUST be one of these single-letters. Use 'D' to mark the instruction as completed. You cannot see things behind you or to the sides. You also can't see things that are too far away. Turn around or move to explore. After a few observations, if you're lost, use a 'D'one action to get a new instruction. Headings are described in degrees, with positive meaning to the right and negative meaning to the left. You are on a discrete hex grid, each turn is 60 degrees. You get a new observation each time you move. Do not hit 'done' until you have completed the instruction. The leader can see things you can't, so trust instructions. After each ACTION line, you will get a new observation, so you can explore a bit. There are no traps, so explore freely.
