- JSON Parson. I decided to use this version of JSON.NET ported to work with
  Unity:

https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity/wiki/Installation-via-UPM

Unity has built-in JSON parsing, but it's limited and doesn't support nested
objects.

- Decided to use an ORM for SQL so that I don't need to generate my own SQL
  queries (seems brittle and like a security target). In particular being able
to see the DB schema defined in the code as an object model is really nice.
Here's a good performance benchmark of different python ORMs:

https://github.com/tortoise/orm-benchmarks

I chose Peewee because it's simple and the performance isn't too bad compared
to others.

- It seems that Unity's InputFields don't work well in WebGL. To fix it I added
  this:

- Better WebGL HTML template:

- For data browsing UIs, I wanted to do as little front-end HTML as possible so I used
  w2ui:

- For performance profiling and optimization, this tool has been instrumental:

https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer

For example, you can launch the server like this:

```
viztracer --tracer_entries=2000000 -m main --config_filepath="config/local-covers-config.json"
```

Keep in mind that traces are stored in a circular buffer and only the most
recent ones will be kept -- old ones discarded. A lot of traces happen, so only
the last few seconds of traces will be kept. This makes it tricky to capture the
correct moment. --tracer_entries above lets you expand the circular buffer to
capture a longer moment of time.
